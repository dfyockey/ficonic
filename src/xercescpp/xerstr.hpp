// 1) A class derived from std::string has been considered and disregarded, at least for now.
//    That's because it would require either transcoding every time the Xerces string was accessed
//    or significant complexity so the std::string and Xerces string are kept in sync and so the latter
//    is released before the std::string was changed and at class destruction.
// 2) Apparently, the stream operator '<<' can't be overloaded because C++ can't determine whether it
//    or one of the other operators (string, XMLCh*, or char*) should be applied when an xerstr is
//    provided as an argument to '<<' in, say, a std::cout stream.
